            <h3> Immune System benefits
            </h3>
            
            <p>Sleep is essential for proper functioning of the immune system and prevention of cancer. In one study, 25 subjects were split into a sleep-deprived group, and a control group that got enough sleep. Both groups were then given influenza vaccination, and their antibody response was measured. The human body produces antibodies to fight disease, and the study showed that sleep-deprived groups produced significantly lower levels of antibodies as compared to the control group. In fact, 10 days after the administration of the vaccination, the sleep-deprived group had less than half the antibody response of the control group. This affect remained even after recovery sleep (where sleep-deprived groups got normal levels of sleep after vaccination), and after 21-31 days, the difference remained. This shows that the body is much better at fighting disease when well rested. 
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, another study by Irwin et al. measured levels of natural killer cells in the body. Natural killer cells fight cancer and kill off infected cells. When subjects were subjected to four hours of sleep reduction, there was a 70% reduction in the level of natural killer cells in the body. The effect is so drastic, that the World Health Organization lists shift work as a probable carcinogen. This is why sleep is so important in both preventions from getting sick!

            <h3> Metabolism benefits
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sleep also has a large effect on metabolism. In one study on diabetes, 11 subjects were split into either a sleep-deprived group receiving four hours of sleep for five nights, or a well-rested group. After this, the subjects all underwent a glucose tolerance test, where they were injected with glucose and the efficiency of the body at removing the glucose was measured. The results revealed that those in the sleep-deprived group had 40% less glucose tolerance (efficiency) as those in the full-sleep group. These levels are comparable to those who are at risk of diabetes, showing that sleep deprivation raises risk of diabetes. 
            </p>
            <p>In addition to diabetes, sleep deprivation also affects the hormones related to appetite regulation, specifically leptin and ghrelin. Leptin is a hormone that inhibits appetite and increases energy expenditure, while ghrelin does the opposite. A study done on these hormones shows that after sleep deprivation (four hours for two nights), leptin levels decreased by 18%, and ghrelin levels increased by 28%. Subjectively, the participants also had a 24% increase in hunger sensation and 32% increase in appetite for carbohydrate-rich foods! This means that sleep will help prevent overeating and high blood sugar.
