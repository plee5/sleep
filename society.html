            <h3> Sleepless
            </h3>

            <p> 
                            Sleeping for 8 hours a night helps to reduce microlapses. There microlapses can have a lot of consequences. There is evidence posted in the New England Journal of Medicine reporting a 160% increase in the risk of traffic accidents due to extended work shifts (Barger et al. 2005). Another study involving medical residents supports that the number of errors made is linked to the number of hours of sleep the residents get on a daily basis (Baldwin & Daugherty 2004). The statistics predict that 1 out of 5 medical residents will seriously harm a patient due to an error caused by fatigue, and 1 out of 20 medical residents will kill a patient for the same reason. Adding up the statistics supports a depressing prediction that ~1000 deaths every year will be caused by sleep deprived residents in training. Several large scale devastating tragedies in history have been associated with sleep deprivation as well, including Exxon Valdez, Chernobyl, Staten Island Ferry, and numerous horrific traffic accidents, all resulting in many lives being lost.

            <h3> Creativity
            </h3>
            <p>
                There are plenty of examples of well known societal figures that have been inspired by dreams or sleep consolidation, and whose brain activity in sleep goes on to largely impact their career.
                For example, Paul McCartney claims he was inspired by his dreams when he wrote two of the Beatles’ very successful songs Yesterday and Let it Be. Dmitri Mendeleev supposedly discovered his pattern for organizing the periodic table of elements in a dream. Other examples of breakthroughs due to productive sleep include Jack Nicklaus’ corrected golf swing after a bad slump, Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,” Otto Loewi’s discovery of neurochemical transmission, and Thomas Edison’s many inventions.

                A research study conducted by German researchers found that students were ~40% more likely to discover a hidden rule in a memory task when they were allowed to sleep after learning compared to staying awake (varied in night and daytime). This was only true for groups that were trained before sleeping; sleep enhanced creativity but not enough for groups to discover the rule without having memories of the task before sleeping (Wagner et al. 2004).
