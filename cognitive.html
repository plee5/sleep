            <h3> Memory benefits
            </h3>
            Sleeping for 8 hours a night helps to improve your memory. Memory is split into two different types: Declarative and Non-Declarative.
            <p> 
            Non-Declarative: Procedural skills are one of many nondeclarative skills. These are skills such as riding a bike. These are split into two--visual skills and motor skills.
            Visual skills are consolidated during early SWS and late REM sleep. These skills are harder to understand because we tend to not think
            about our visual skills. A study had participants determine if all the lines in a picture were moving in the same direction. This study found
            that participants who were sleep deprived did not improve throughout the study. Motor skills are skills such as riding a bike or dribbling a basketball. 
            These skills are consolidated during Stage 2 NREM sleep late in the night. A study found that sleeping 8 hours after learning a task significantly
            improved the participants performance in that task.
            <p>
                Declarative: Declarative skills include two categories: episodic and semantic. Episodic memory is related to events while semantic memory
                is related to facts. In a study in 1924, people had to learn 10 nonsense syllables. After sleeping, they improved significantly in recalling the syllables.
                In particular, NREM SWS helped in declarative memory retention. There have been many more studies that show that sleep is beneficial to memory retention,
                especially SWS. In the future, there might even be a device that can directly stimulate SWS to help patients with dementia!

            <h3> Emotional benefits
            </h3>
            Studies show that sleeping more helps ones emotion. If you have ever noticed that when you are tired, you get agitated more
            easily, you have experienced the drawback of sleep deprivation on your emotions. Essentially, when you are sleepy, your
            brain cannot communicate effectively. The particular parts of your brain that play a role in your emotions are the
            <b>amygdala</b> and the <b>medial frontal cortex</b>.
            <p>
                The amygdala and the medial frontal cortex play a role in one's emotions. The amygdala is the control center for emotion. The medial
                frontal cortex acts as a regulator to regulate how much the amygdala's activity is output. When one is sleep deprived, this connection
                is gone and the amygdala is free to output anything, no matter how severe. A good analogy for this is that the amygdala is the gas pedal
                and the medial frontal cortex is the brake. When one is sleep deprived, their brake is malfunctional and all their brains is outputting
                is gas from the amygdala. Because of this, one's emotions may change abruptly and be more enhanced.
